Getting back on the bandwagon by more closely documenting my progress :+1:

### Speeding Up Intersection Code

By using PyCharm's profiler I found about 65% of my code was in calculating intersections between the segments (geometry) and casted rays. So to speed up code which was now taking tens of minutes I've focused on speeding this up significantly.

The intersection code is basic algorithm, but loops over the segments in a Python for loop which is slow. To speed up this is being converted to a compiled C function extension which can be called by the geometry class

I actually converted to doing numpy without a for loop first, but it was just as slow as the naive implementation.

### Profile Results for Transmission Test
```python
intersect_segment = np.array([start, end])
intercepts, indexes = [], []

for i, segment in enumerate(self.mesh.segments):
    intercept = math2d.intersect(segment, intersect_segment, ray)
    if intercept is not None:
        intercepts.append(np.array(intercept))
        indexes.append(i)
```
