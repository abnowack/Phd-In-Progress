##### Including TikZ graphs in ipython notebooks

Need to install [ipython magic extension for tikz](https://github.com/mkrphys/ipython-tikzmagic)

For initial setup, open any ipython notebook and enter 

`%install_ext https://github.com/mkrphys/ipython-tikzmagic/blob/master/tikzmagic.py`

Then to use afterwards include

`%load_ext tikzmagic`

On windows with my latex installation I also needed to imgconvert.exe which is provided by imagemagick. So I installed the windows binary distribution [here](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php#windows)
