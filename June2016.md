# Cython Notes

### Three Types of Functions
- def function_name(args)

  Python function compiled as type builtin_function_or_method which is not a C-function. It is a python extensible object with exceptions that attributes like __name__ are not modifiable in Cython. Return values are python objects. Usually 2-3 times performance improvements. Handles Exceptions automatically.

- cdef function_name(cdef args)

  Compiled as a C-function with C arguments and C return values. Can be called by other Cython code, but not by Python directly. Must wrap it in a def wrapper_function in the Cython code for external Python code to use. Must be aware of Python -> C type conversion and overflow errors.

- cpdef function_name(cdef args)

  Combines the functionality of two previous methods by compiling the function as a C function but provides a Python funciton wrapper of the same name. No performance difference compared to cdef function_name. However the return type is limited to those compatible with both C and Python. Return types of void, C pointers and C arrays are excluded.

### Passing Exceptions in Cython Functions

For cdef and cpdef, exceptions can be handled by having Cython either always check if an exception was raised, check only if it returns a specific value, or if the return value does not occur normally raise the exception everytime if that value is returned.

cpdef function(int i) except *:   # Always check global exception state if exception raised

cpdef function(int i) except? -1: # While -1 may be a valid return value, check if exception was raised if -1 is returned

cpdef function(int i) except -1:  # -1 is not possible as a return value normally, no exception check needed
